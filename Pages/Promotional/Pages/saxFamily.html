        <h1 class="titles">The Different Types Of Saxophones</h1>
        <p class="decorLines"></p>
        <p>Originally there were 14 members of the saxophone family. In fact, Adolphe Sax conceived of an orchestra consisting solely of saxophones, and so he made saxophones in a range of sizes. Yet today, there are only 6 types in widespread use. In pitch order from high to low, they are the sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass.</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sopranino</strong>
                </li>
                <img class="left" src="../Imgs/Family/Sopranino.jpg">
                <p>This is the smaller version of the soprano saxophone. It has a higher octave compared to the alto saxophone. You can find sopranino saxophone mostly in film scores, big band recordings and modern classical music. It’s a small type of saxophone that requires some finger dexterity for it to be able to play.</p>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Soprano</strong>
                </li>
                <img class="right" src="../Imgs/Family/Soprano.jpg">
                <p>
                    <br>This is the highest-pitched common type of saxophone. It’s a transposing instrument. When you play a C, the actual sound will be a concert pitch Bb because it’s in the key of Bb. Soprano plays a similar range to a Bb trumpet, and it can range from Ab3 to E6, depending on the musician’s ability.
                </p>
                <p>The unique design of the soprano makes it the only saxophone with a straightened out bore. But you can still find some saxophone versions that also contain straightened out bore. The soprano sax is mostly used in smooth jazz since it became popular in the 80s courtesy of Kenny G’s artist.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alto</strong>
                </li>
                <img class="left" src="../Imgs/Family/Alto.jpg">
                <p>This is the best saxophone for beginners. It’s the most popular saxophone, particularly with student players. Many saxophone players start with an alto saxophone before proceeding to other types of the saxophone. It’s pitched to E flat. It’s small in size and has a small mouthpiece which makes it easy to learn. The younger players don’t find it hard to play an alto saxophone.</p>
                <p>Alto saxophone contains similar fingering to all saxophones, making the alto players easily graduate to other saxophone types and develop their skills. You can find alto saxophone mainly in jazz bands.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tenor</strong>
                </li>
                <img class="right" src="../Imgs/Family/Tenor.jpg">
                <p>The tenor saxophone is the most famous saxophone. It’s larger than alto and has a lower pitch. It isn’t suitable for beginners. It’s a larger instrument that requires more air to be blown through it to produce sound. Although it’s not common among young players, it’s widely used saxophone in pop, jazz music and rock.</p>
                <p>It has the same range as a male singer and contains a darker tone quality, making it a sonic fit for any genre. Most of the saxophone players start with alto and then move up to tenor saxophone to develop breathing and fingering skills.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Baritone</strong>
                </li>
                <img class="left" src="../Imgs/Family/Baritone.jpg">
                <p>The baritone saxophone is the largest among the first four common types of the saxophone. Bari sax is an Eb instrument which has a much lower tone. Many people don’t like using the baritone saxophone because of its features. Such features include its size, weight and a large amount of air you’ll need to produce sound.</p>
                <p>This is the suitable saxophone you need to use if you’re a beginner, although it was also ideal for advanced saxophonists. For you to play it, you’ve to support the weight of this instrument by wearing a harness. The baritone saxophone is most common in music ensembles and solo jazz that requires a deep bass sound.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bass</strong>
                </li>
                <img class="right" src="../Imgs/Family/Bass.jpg">
                <p>Going bigger with instruments is quite easier than getting smaller with the same instruments, and that’s why you’ll come across bass saxophone. It’s generally big, and that’s why you need to rest it on a stand while playing by using the neck curving down to its halfway body.</p>
                <p>It’s perfect for concert bands and larger jazz ensembles because of the full pitched octave below the tenor saxophone, giving it a rich supporting sound.</p>
